Tekken 7 SteamVer Replay, Customize, Rank Info Backup


It is a program for users who play Tekken 7 on Steam. 

Tekken 7 can store up to 30 replay files. 
If you play games nonstop, you can't watch games after the 30th edition again and it's hard to analyze. 
In other words, there is a hassle of storing replay files separately for every 30 editions. 
Even that, if you have a favorite replay file, the number of replay files that can be stored is reduced. 

The program I created makes it easy to manage replay files without stopping during play. 
And if I use my account from place to place, 
my program will be of great help even if it lose customization or rank data due to failed account synchronization.

The method of use is very easy, so I won't explain it separately. 
But if you have difficulty using it, please contact me.
